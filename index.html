<h1>The Responsibility</h1>
<ol>
<li>Brothers</li>
<li>About My LIfe</li>
<li>Contacts</li>
</ol>
<p> You have to deal with a lot of pain, Your always getting annoyed and picked on. Being the middle sibling basically means you are the punching bag of the bunch. But you learn to get use to it and deal with it.</p>  
<p> Very often do I have to remind my younger brother, Brecc, to do things and to not do things.</p>
<p> My bigger brother graduated high school and is off to college so that even brings more weight on my shoulders.</P>
<h2> How to Relieve Some Stress</h2>
<p> Have some daily exercise, get out and be active.</p>
<p> Find a fun video game and play all night.</p>
